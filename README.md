## predicting-credit-card-fraud-with-EDA-and-classification-modelling
Employing EDA and classification algorithms like Log-Reg and Ensemble models to predict fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Overview
This project aims to predict credit card fraud by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building various classification models. The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced, making it a challenging task. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry. This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a combination of EDA and various machine learning models. The project covers:

Understanding the data through EDA.
Data preprocessing techniques.
Implementation of multiple classification algorithms.
Model evaluation and comparison.
